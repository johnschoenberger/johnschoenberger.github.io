# Build
I originally was going to use cheap Ikea Lak tables like I did for my 3D printer enclosure. FYSA the width of Ikea Lak tables is the same as most rack mount servers. Keep in mind the length or depth depending on the server case you choose will determine how far out the back it sticks.

However, I knew I'd be building out my homelab for personal and work enablement so I opted for a Startech 25U rack. This rack comes with casters and is depth adjustable. I wish it came with a cap for the top, but a simple piece of plywood/MDF is a cheaper route to go.
